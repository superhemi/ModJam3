1. You must have Eclipse IDE.

2. Download the Minecraft Forge source 1.6.4. The version used for this mod is 9.11.1.935.

3. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to an empty folder.

4. Run the "install" script (this may take a while).

5. Set the Eclipse workspace as ""foldername"/forge/mcp/eclipse"

6. Download this mod as a zip.

7. Extract the contents to a different folder.

8. Inside the "common" folder will be a folder titled "com". Inside that will be a folder titled "superhemi". Inside that will be a folder titled "PirateCraft" or something like that. Create a package in the Eclipse workspace titled "com.superhemi.PirateCraft".

9. There will be folders inside the "PirateCraft" folder. You will need to create packages for those as well (Example: com.superhemi.PirateCraft.block")

10. Do the same for the assets folder (Example: resources.assets.piracraft.textures.items)

11. Copy the Java files into their corresponding packages.

12. Copy the textures into their corresponding packages.

13. Check for errors and fix them.

14. Save Eclipse.

15. Navigate to ""foldername"/forge/mcp" and run the Recompile script. Ignore any errors.

16. Run the Reobfuscate script and ignore any errors.

17. The compiled files will be in  ""foldername"/forge/mcp/reobf". Add the "folder to a new zip archive.

18. Find the assets folder: ""foldername"/forge/mcp/src/minecraft/assets". Add this to the same archive as in 17.

19. That zip archive is now a functional mod.
